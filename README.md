## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a self-driven developer from Algeria who builds where the digital meets the physical. I specialize in the full stack—from clean, functional interfaces built on modern primitives like shadcn/ui to the bare-metal logic of embedded systems.

My foundation is in low-level systems and Rust, which instilled a "no-magic" approach to software. I don't just build apps; I build real-world products that ship—ranging from gym and school management platforms to my current work in drone and IoT infrastructure. I prioritize performance, maintainable architecture, and systems that don't break under pressure.

When I'm not writing code, I'm probably learning something I didn't know I needed yet.
